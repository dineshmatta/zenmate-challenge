# ZenMate Frontend Engineering Challenge
A JS engineer at ZenMate is often tasked with giving web apps a solid structure from the ground up so that they stay maintainable and performant for a long time.

The task for this challenge is to create a small web application that talks to an external API.

Your site will display the current server status of all ZenMate servers. We provide fake data at the url <http://js-challenge.zenmate.io/>.

_See more details in the specification_: [SPECS](/SPECS.md)

_You can find a documentation of the mock API here_ : [API_DOCS](/API_DOCS.md)

## Rules

- __Use any language, framework, library or design resources you want__ (It should be appropriate for the scope of the task)
- The result must run in a modern browser (forget IE9) without plugins
- The result must be (or compile to) JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- All compilation steps must be reproducible given only the data in your repository.
- There is no time limit, but..
- __This is not about who can put the most time into it.__ We require you to complete the [formal specs](/SPECS.md) and we're confident that this is enough to judge the quality of your codebase. This task took most of our engineers a couple of hours to complete. 

## Procedure

1. Solve the challenge at your own pace.

2. If you have completed the [formal specs](/SPECS.md) and feel confident to show off the code
    - Push your final code to GitHub in a separate branch
    - Create a pull request for your branch
    - Send an email to your contact at ZenGuard GmbH to notify them of your pull request.
    - Be available occasionally to answer initial questions on the pull requests by team members involved in the process

3. We will contact you to arrange for a follow-up interview/code presentation

4. On the **day of the presentation**:

    - Be prepared to provide a quick overview over your changes (shouldn't take longer than 10 - 15 minutes)
    - Be able to explain how you resolved the challenge to a couple of people from our team.
    - Be able to answer questions about your implementation (should they arise)

You may, of course, ask questions as well, either about the code base, the development model or any other topic related to the challenge. All in all the whole event will probably not take longer than 90 minutes. Afterwards there will be time to see you around the office, discuss details etc.
